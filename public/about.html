<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Computer Science mayor student.  Hungry to learn about coding and seems to be a passion of mine. Outside of this I also like
  to do other things like playing videogames, going out with friends and watching lots of movies and tv shows.
</p>

<p>I personally enjoy coding the most, the idea of creating something to help facilitate people's life is something that I like. 
  I'm still in the beggining process of learning and I still don't know a lot, but I'm a fast learner and I'm cofident I can make
  this happen for myself. Ever since I was a kid I had "gift" with computers and anything that had to do with electroics, so it 
  seemed pretty natural for me. I want to be able to learn about a programming language and get really good at it and after that
  I'll decide what other language can be usefull to add to my knowledge. So far my goal is to create a web site so i can have something 
  I created of my own and fel proud of, even if it's just a simple website.  
</p>

<p>I'm aware it's not going to be easy but I'm not afraid of that and I'm always trying to challenge myself to do better and be better.
  after a few moth I expect to be able to have enough knowledge to create websites and later other applications.
